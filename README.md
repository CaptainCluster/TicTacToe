# TicTacToe
A functional TicTacToe game, where there are two difficulties (one of them is still being worked on).

The game works exactly like the traditional TicTacToe we all love. You will fight against an opponent,
whose moves are determined by an algorithm. There are two different difficulties:

1. The medium difficulty (in the dumbopponent.js file)
   This opponent has an algorithm that can detect if there are tiles to be filled that lead to victory.
   It can also detect whether the player is about to win.

   What makes this opponent easier than the second one is that it relies on a randomized input, should
   it find no good tiles to fill. Don't let this fool you, though. The opponent is able to put up some
   challenge.

2. The "impossible" difficulty (NOT RELEASED YET)
   This opponent has an algorithm that is designed in a way that leaves the player praying that there
   is a victory instead of a draw one day.
